##Importance of Choosing a License

##Gopher vs. W3
It seems like a lack of openness was one of many factors that contributed to the decline of Gopher. I agree it played a part in the decline but was not the sole, or major reason. I think the largest factors to its decline were in the inherent structure of the program as compared to W3 which was much more open and adaptable to the rapidly changing technological landscape.

##Linux License:
Linux uses the GPLv2 to promote free software. One of the biggest benefits of open source is the distributuion of modifications and the GPLv2 license prevents people from taking free software and using it for monetary gain. The GPLv2 prevents modification of Linux without the GPL license, therefore verifying it remains free software.
