##Importance of Choosing a License

##Gopher vs. W3
It seems like a lack of openness was one of many factors that contributed to the decline of Gopher. I agree it played a part in the decline but was not the sole, or major reason. I think the largest factors to its decline were in the inherent structure of the program as compared to W3 which was much more open and adaptable to the rapidly changing technological landscape.

##Linux License:
Linux uses the GPLv2 to promote free software. One of the biggest benefits of open source is the distributuion of modifications and the GPLv2 license prevents people from taking free software and using it for monetary gain. The GPLv2 prevents modification of Linux without the GPL license, therefore verifying it remains free software. 

##Example Project License:
An example project would be making an app that tracks trending news stories and combines them into one feed by popularity and relevance. It could also bring up a Democtratic and Republican article for political issues. I would use a GPL License to ensure someone would not be able to repackage and sell the software. Other than that though, it would be free to use and modify by all. 


##Project and License:
I am making CAPP reports for dual majors and I will be using the MIT License. It combines the CAPP reports of dual majors and makes a single, composite report. It is really open-ended and promotes the use of free software. Because it is RPI specific, I doubt it can be used for monetary gain which is why a GPL license is not necessary. The MIT license allows for a little more openness in case there was a reason someone wanted to use the program, but needed a different license.
