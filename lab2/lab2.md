##2. Importance of Choosing a License:
It is important to choose a license in order to protect your intellectual property. Although a license can be permitting unlimited use of your product, it may still require credit be given to the author. In addition, other licenses ensure products cannot be used for monetary gain and others protect private companies' code.

##3. Projects Without a License:
You should not use projects without a license because you do not get a free use guarantee that comes with a license. If you use software without a license the author can take legal action against you. The license acts as permission to use the software as long as the requirements are met. 

##4. Gopher vs. W3:
It seems like a lack of openness was one of many factors that contributed to the decline of Gopher. I agree it played a part in the decline but was not the sole, or major reason. I think the largest factors to its decline were in the inherent structure of the program as compared to W3 which was much more open and adaptable to the rapidly changing technological landscape.

##5. Linux License:
Linux uses the GPLv2 to promote free software. One of the biggest benefits of open source is the distributuion of modifications and the GPLv2 license prevents people from taking free software and using it for monetary gain. The GPLv2 prevents modification of Linux without the GPL license, therefore verifying it remains free software. 

##6. Example Project License:
An example project would be making an app that tracks trending news stories and combines them into one feed by popularity and relevance. It could also bring up a Democtratic and Republican article for political issues. I would use a GPL License to ensure someone would not be able to repackage and sell the software. Other than that though, it would be free to use and modify by all. 

##7. License Comparison
The Apache License seems to be the most open and would therefore most likely be the best for the common good. It allows almost unlimited use as long as credit is given. The more open software is the better it is for the public and I think the Apache license accomplishes this. The LGPL license seems like it would benefit corporations the most because they tend to be the ones who produce libraries for public use. It allows for unlimited use of the library and modification with credit. The GPL license seems to be the best for other software from companies as well. If a company produces opensource software, it restricts another company from slightly modifying it and then reselling it which protects them and the integrity of opensource. For a developer, it entirely depends on the nature of the program as to which license to use. The Apache license is the most versatile and least restrictive so in many cases that is beneficial. However, if the developer is producing a significant product, he/she may benefit more from the protection afforded by a GPL license.

##9. Project and License:
I am making CAPP reports for dual majors and I will be using the MIT License. It combines the CAPP reports of dual majors and makes a single, composite report. It is really open-ended and promotes the use of free software. Because it is RPI specific, I doubt it can be used for monetary gain which is why a GPL license is not necessary. The MIT license allows for a little more openness in case there was a reason someone wanted to use the program, but needed a different license.
