The first three projects differed greatly in gitstats from the information that we found manually.  this may be because they were larger-scale projects that may not have been done completely in github, so github does not have all of the correct information.

#Part 3
pyLemma: Edgchess seems like the clear leader of this project. He was constantly committing and making changes all over the project.

QuickCast: This was a big project and it was difficult to tell, but I don't think there was a leader.

RPI Tours: It seems like YOUR NAME was the project leader. While everybody committed on the project frequently, he committed in almost every area and more frequently than other members.

Ruma: Jimmy Cuadra was definitely the leader. Other group members participated sparingly.

Scaffold: Very incomplete project. Christina-Hammer was the leader.
