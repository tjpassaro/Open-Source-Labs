###c.1 10 Criteria of Open Source Definition:
  I think these stipulations are very important in ensuring the integrity and validity of open-source. If developers were allowed to publish code as open source but restrict its access to certain activities or restrict its redistribution then open-source would not be what it is today. It also gives users the confidence in knowing they cannot be legally responsible for using code that is seemingly open-source but has corner-cases or certain stipulations. 
  
###c.2 How To Ask Questions in a Smart Way
  He talked a lot about how to get your question answered which is one of the most important parts of askign one. With thousands of questions being asked every day, yours has to stand out. I also agree with his point about asking about a goal instead of a pathway to it. Everybody has experienced times when they were stuck trying to get something to work and then realizing there is a completely different way to do it. By leaving your question open-ended, it allows for other possibile solutions other than just fixing your specific problem. 
  
  An additional suggestion would be to try rephrasing your question in your web search a few times. Sometimes people have the same issue and just phrase it differently. I have found answers to many of my questions simply be rephrasing it. Another step that may help is giving a little bit of background information into why you need to do what you are doing to both help define the scope of the problem and also allow for work-arounds you may not have known are possible.
  
###c.3 Free Culture- Chapter 3
  I think it is completely outrageous he can sued for that. He had no control over what was being searched and the only reason the RIAA can get away with that is because it is such a large organization and he is a student. By this reasoning, Google should also be at fault however, they have the money and legal team to defend against it so the RIAA will not go after them. I am curious as to why RPI wouldn't defend him if it is on RPI's network, he was working for the benefit of RPI, and he is a student there. I think that if Jesse had RPI's legal team, the RIAA would have backed off because they know the case will not hold up in court. Regardless, there should always be contracts in place barring the programmer from reprecussions for non-technical aspects of his work if he is writing for a client. This has relevance in the open-source community but can be applied to almost any programming job.
