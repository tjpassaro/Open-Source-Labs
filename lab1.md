###10 Criteria of Open Source Definition:
  I think these stipulations are very important in ensuring the integrity and validity of open-source. If developers were allowed to publish code as open source but restrict its access to certain activities or restrict its redistribution then open-source would not be what it is today. It also gives users the confidence in knowing they cannot be legally responsible for using code that is seemingly open-source but has corner-cases and certain stipulations.
