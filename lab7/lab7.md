#Lab 7

There is an approximately 45 second run time but with the correct output. It was running faster this way then when I tried to generate all combinations of 1 letter changes in any order and I think it is because checking n*125*26ln(n) is not much faster than generating all edges and traversing with those due to the time it takes for each process.
